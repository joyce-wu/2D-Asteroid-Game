# 2D-Asteroid-Game

### HW 1.1: Shapes and Patterns
Implement 2D shape drawing with WebGL as the first milestone of 2D project. 
* Built simple shapes by implementing geometry class to draw a donut, serpentine, and crescent.
* Drew parametric heart and clover shapes by evaluating a formula to obtain perimeter vertices.
* Drew striped and checkered patterns by outputting model space position and changing fragment shaders based on vertex position.
* Animated patterns with heartbeat and blinking by passing time to shaders in a uniform.
* Animated shapes to wave and pinch by passing time to offset vertex positions.
* Added arrow move and mouse events for shapes to respond to.

### HW 1.2: Objects and Transformations
Implement 2D scene editing features as the second milestone of 2D project.
* Maintain an array of selected game objects to manipulate by mouse events.
* Manipulate object positions through mouse drag and arrow move.
* Edit object orientation with key rotate.
* Delete and add new objects on key press.
* Scroll and pam window on key press and mouse drag to see entire world.
* Transforming mouse coordinates from normalized device coordinates to word space coordinates using the inverse of the camera's view-projection matrix.

### HW 1.3: Game Using Textures and Physics
Finish 2D Asteroids game.
* Apply torque to avatar object with key press.
* Asteroid collision with texture animation with sprites when asteroids collide.
* Exhaust flames on key press with avater using parenting game objects.
* Click space to shoot a projectile with cooldown time.
